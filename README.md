<h1>ISTQB Foundation Level Exam</h1>

<p>ISTQB Foundation Level Exam is a certification exam for software testers who want to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in the field of software testing. The exam covers the fundamental concepts of software testing, such as test design, execution, and management. It also covers different types of testing, such as functional and non-functional testing, and testing techniques, such as black box and white box testing. Passing the exam is a prerequisite for the higher level ISTQB certifications.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The current ISTQB Foundation Level exam (3.1) can be taken through May 9, 2024. The ISTQB Foundation Level exam 4.0 (CTFL 4.0) will be available in the middle of this year. If you wish to take the ISTQB Foundation Level in the next several months, we strongly recommend you take the current version of the ISTQB Foundation Level exam. That is because excellent training and study resources are available for the current version, but not yet available for the 4.0 version. Both versions are equally valid and lead to the same certification, so we believe it will be easier for you to prepare for the current exam version.</p>

<p>Fourth, it can be helpful to join a study group or find a study partner. This can provide you with support, motivation, and accountability. You can work together to review the exam topics, ask questions, and discuss difficult concepts.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to stay calm and confident during the exam. Don&#39;t let anxiety or stress affect your performance. Take deep breaths, stay focused, and trust in your preparation. With the right mindset and preparation, you can pass the ISTQB Foundation Level Exam and demonstrate your knowledge and skills in the field of software testing.</p>
